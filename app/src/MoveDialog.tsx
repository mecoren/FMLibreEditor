// Transferring a player to another club: the button in the header of his profile, and the dialog it opens. The dialog
// picks the club (and, if wanted, a fee and a new wage and contract end), asks the game whether the move can be made
// before it offers it, and makes it: the buying club pays the fee to the selling one. The transfer is logged like any
// change, and one undo from the Changes view takes back the move and the fee.
//
// A switch at the top of the dialog makes it a swap instead: after the club it picks one of the club's players, who
// goes the other way, and each keeps his own contract.
//
// A full squad list is made bigger. Where the editor cannot make it bigger (see `Session::growth`), a club whose squad
// list is full cannot take one more player: the dialog then offers to make room, in a box where the refusal would be:
// one of the club's players is released in the same transfer, logged and undone with it, or the transfer becomes a
// swap with him.
//
// For a free agent, who has no club, the dialog signs him for the club picked: no fee and no swap, and a new contract
// the editor makes on the terms given, or on those the plan shows.
//
// A member of staff moves with no fee, no terms and no swap: in their own job, or in another picked from the jobs the
// editor gives. One who has no club is signed like a free agent, in the job picked.
