//! A stadium's name, changed in place or given anew.
//!
//! A stadium points at its name (`[stadium] name`), an FM string: a `u32` length, the text in UTF-8 and a NUL, after a
//! `u32` count of the objects that hold it. The allocator's block starts 8 bytes before that count, with a `u32` of the
//! size it was asked for (the length plus 9: the count, the length, the text and the NUL) and a `u32` the editor leaves
//! as it is. On the Game Pass save Old Trafford (12 bytes, asked-for size 21) sits in a block of 32, right after
//! Kenilworth Road's (15, 24). On the Mac blocks come in steps of 8 (`[heap] string_step`): 24 for up to 7 bytes, 32 for
//! 8 to 15, 40 for 16 to 23, so the Emirates Stadium (16 bytes) sits in a block of 40, not 48. Steps of 8 are safe where
//! the game's are 16 too, as a block of 8 lies within the block of 16 it falls in, so both layouts take 8; the steps hold
//! up to the longest name the editor writes.
//!
//! A new name that keeps the size of the block, for a name the stadium alone holds (a count of 1), is written over the
//! old one: the size word, the length and the text. Any other goes into memory the editor takes in the game for it
//! (`Process::allocate`), laid out as the game's strings are, and the stadium is pointed at it. The game's allocator
//! knows nothing of that memory, so those strings get a count of holders the game never brings down to nothing: it
//! never lets them go. The old name stays where it was, for its other holders or for the undo. Each write keeps the
//! bytes it found, so one undo puts the old name back. Where the editor cannot take memory, only the first kind of
//! rename is offered.
